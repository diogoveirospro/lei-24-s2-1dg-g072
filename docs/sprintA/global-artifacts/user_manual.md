## Introduction
## System Overview

The main goal of the system developed under this project is to offer an integrated solution for the effective 
management of green spaces for collective use, such as gardens and parks, to be used by town and parish councils.
This application is designed to optimize operations related to the maintenance and planning of these spaces, facilitating 
the management of multidisciplinary teams, the allocation of resources, the control of fleets and equipment, the 
optimization of irrigation and lighting systems, and the production of statistical indicators that make it possible to 
assess the performance of the activities carried out.

### System Structure

The structure of the application is organized around several main modules that interact with each other to offer 
cohesive and integrated management of green spaces:

1. **Collaborator Management**: This module is responsible for registering and managing collaborators, including their 
competences, functions, and assignment to teams. It allows the Human Resources Manager (HRM) to create and manage
collaborators' profiles, record their skills and associate them with specific tasks.


2. **Team Management**: Facilitates the creation and management of multidisciplinary teams, allowing the HRM to compose 
teams based on the skills required to carry out the tasks in the various green spaces.


3. **Vehicle and Equipment Management**: This module allows the Vehicle and Equipment Fleet Manager (FM) to register 
and control vehicles and equipment, ensuring their proper maintenance and availability for scheduled tasks.


### Main Features

- Flexible Resource Management: The application provides flexible management of collaborators, teams, vehicles, and 
equipment, adapting to the dynamic needs of green space management.
