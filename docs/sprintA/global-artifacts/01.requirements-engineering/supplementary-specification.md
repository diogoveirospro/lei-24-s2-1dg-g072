# Supplementary Specification (FURPS+)

## Functionality

_Specifies functionalities that:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (i) are common across several US/UC;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (ii) are not related to US/UC, namely: Audit, Reporting and Security._

&nbsp; &nbsp; (1)  Skills registered on US01 are used in US02, US03 and US04;

&nbsp; &nbsp; (2)  Vehicles registered on US06 are used in US07 and US08.


## Usability

_Evaluates the user interface. It has several subcategories,
among them: error prevention; interface aesthetics and design; help and
documentation; consistency and standards._

1. Develop a Portal in which parks and garden users can post comments, and report faults and malfunctions of equipment.
2. The diary is a crucial mechanism for planning the week’s work. Each entry in the diary
   defines a task.  Comparatively analyzing the
   diary entries and the pending tasks. Allows the evaluation of the work.
3. Javadoc will be used to generate useful documentation for Java code.
## Reliability

_Refers to the integrity, compliance and interoperability of the software. The requirements to be considered are: frequency and severity of failure, possibility of recovery, possibility of prediction, accuracy, average time between failures._

1. Business rules validation must be respected when recording and updating data. 
2. The class structure must be designed to allow easy maintenance and the addition
of new features, following the best OO practices.


## Performance

_Evaluates the performance requirements of the software, namely: response time, start-up time, recovery time, memory consumption, CPU usage, load capacity and application availability._

(fill in here )

## Supportability

_The supportability requirements gathers several characteristics, such as:
testability, adaptability, maintainability, compatibility,
configurability, installability, scalability and more._

The class structure must be designed to allow easy maintenance and the addition
of new features, following the best OO practices.

### Design Constraints

_Specifies or constraints the system design process. Examples may include: programming languages, software process, mandatory standards/patterns, use of development tools, class library, etc._

The application must be developed in Java language using the IntelliJ IDE or
NetBeans. The application’s graphical interface is to be developed in JavaFX 11. Adopt the best practices for identifying requirements, 
and for OO software analysis and design. Adopt recognized coding standards (e.g., CamelCase).


### Implementation Constraints

_Specifies or constraints the code or construction of a system such
such as: mandatory standards/patterns, implementation languages,
database integrity, resource limits, operating system._

All those who wish to use the application must be authenticated with a password
of seven alphanumeric characters, including three capital letters and two digits.
The application must support the English language.

• The development team must implement unit tests for all methods, except for
methods that implement Input/Output operations. The unit tests should be
implemented using the JUnit 5 framework. 

• The application should use object serialization to ensure data persistence between
two runs of the application.

### Interface Constraints

_Specifies or constraints the features inherent to the interaction of the
system being developed with other external systems._

The JaCoCo plugin should be used
to generate the coverage report.

### Physical Constraints

_Specifies a limitation or physical requirement regarding the hardware used to house the system, as for example: material, shape, size or weight._

• All the images/figures produced during the software development process should
be recorded in SVG format.
