# OO Analysis

The construction process of the domain model is based on the client specifications, especially the nouns (for _concepts_) and verbs (for _relations_) used.

## Rationale to identify domain conceptual classes
To identify domain conceptual classes, start by making a list of candidate conceptual classes inspired by the list of categories suggested in the book "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development".


### _Conceptual Class Category List_

**Business Transactions**

* Task

---

**Transaction Line Items**

* 

---

**Product/Service related to a Transaction or Transaction Line Item**

* Fleet Manager (FM)
* Green Spaces Manager (GSM)
* Green Spaces User (GSU)
* Human Resources Manager (HRM)

**Documents mentioned/used to perform some work/**

*

## Rationale to identify associations between conceptual classes

An association is a relationship between instances of objects that indicates a relevant connection and that is worth of remembering, or it is derivable from the List of Common Associations:

- **_A_** is physically or logically part of **_B_**
- **_A_** is physically or logically contained in/on **_B_**
- **_A_** is a description for **_B_**
- **_A_** known/logged/recorded/reported/captured in **_B_**
- **_A_** uses or manages or owns **_B_**
- **_A_** is related with a transaction (item) of **_B_**
- etc.


| Concept (A) 		|  Association   	|  Concept (B) |
|----------	   		|:-------------:		|------:       |
| C1  	| verb1    		 	| C2  |
| ...  	| ...    		 	| ...  |



## Domain Model

**Do NOT forget to identify concept atributes too.**
