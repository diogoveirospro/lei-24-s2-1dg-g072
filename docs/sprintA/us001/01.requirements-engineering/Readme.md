### 1.1. User Story Description

As a HRM I want to record competences that can be attributed to an employee.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

>	Each task is characterized by having a unique reference per organization, a designation, an informal and a technical description, an estimated duration and cost, as well as a task category. 

>	As long as it is not published, access to the task is exclusive to the employees of the respective organization. 

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Which is the unit of measurement used to estimate duration?
>
> **Answer:** Duration is estimated in days.
